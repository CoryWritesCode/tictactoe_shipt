## Tech Stack

* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
* [RN Style Tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons-css/react-native-style-tachyons)
* [PropTypes](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types)

## How to play

1. Clone the repo.
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn run ios` / `yarn run android`
4. Play the game!

*note: to run on android you will need a device or emulator connected.*  
*If you forget to connect your device when running the android command you can run `yarn run install-to-android` once you connect a device/emulator.*

## Other Commands

* `yarn start` - to start the metro bundler (when you run the `ios` or `android` commands this will already start in another terminal window)
* `yarn open` - to open the project in xcode
* `yarn clean` - to clear node_modules and get a fresh yarn.lock
